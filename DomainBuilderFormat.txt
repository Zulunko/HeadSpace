Text Representation Format for Domain Building:
In order to buid a domain for the HeadSpace algorithm, the following files are recommended.

-----------------------------------------
1. types.txt
This file lists all the possible heirarchial classes in the domain. 
- Each line must be of the following type: X IS-A Y.
- The Y in the first line will be used as the root of the types tree that will be built.
- X and Y can be uppercase, lowercase, mixed, and contain dashes and numbers. They must not contain any other special characters apart from dashes.

Example:
LivingThings IS-A Objects
Persons IS-A LivingThings
Creatures IS-A LivingThings
WildAnimals IS-A Creatures
Pets IS-A Creatures
Weapons IS-A Objects
Locations IS-A Objects
-----------------------------------------
2. instances.txt
This file lists all the possible literals in the domain.
- Each line must be of the following type: X IS-A Y.
- The X must be a ground instance and the Y must be one of the types defined in types.txt.
- X can be uppercase, lowercase, mixed, and contain dashes and numbers. X must not contain any other special characters apart from dashes.

Example:
John IS-A Persons
Dragon IS-A WildAnimals
Dog IS-A Pets
Unicorn IS-A Creatures
Gun IS-A Weapons
Bomb IS-A Weapons
Knife IS-A Weapons
Kitchen IS-A Locations
-----------------------------------------
3. operators.txt
This file defines all possible operators that can be performed in the domain, along with specifications.

Example:
{
kill
args:
(?killer Persons)
(?target Persons)
(?place Locations)
char:?killer
loc: ?place
pre-t:
(at ?killer room2)
(at ?target ?place)
eff-t:
pre-bplus:
pre-bminus:
pre-u:
eff-bplus:
eff-bminus:
eff-u:
}

Create literals on the fly
No overloading of literals... literal relation-names are unique
